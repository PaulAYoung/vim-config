vim-config
==========

Just my vim config. 


##Setup

I use neobundle to manage vim plugins. You'll need to get it into your bundle folder and run NeoBundleInstall. Just take a look at https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim

The YouCompleteMe plugin may not compile correctly using neobundles build instructions. If this happens, follow the install instruction at https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.
